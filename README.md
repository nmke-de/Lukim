# Lukim

**Lukim** is a read-only frontend for [Reddit](https://reddit.com).

Work in progress.

## But why?

[Libreddit](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit)- and [Teddit](https://codeberg.org/teddit/teddit) occasionally get rate-limited. To help with that, I had the option to install either of these on my local computer (possible through AUR) or to write my own.

## Dependencies

[**Deno**](https://deno.com). The server may also be started with [Bun](https://bun.sh), but you are on your own if you do that.

## Usage

`cd` to this directory, then type `./index.js`.
